# GamerIt
By WhatTheCodeDoin?

## Introduction:
  GamerIt is a one-Stop for all gamers. It's a place where people can come together and share their experiences with each other by the means of posts and comments. People can keep notes of their favorite game cheat codes and also mark down future gaming events in a handy Calendar. But that's not all, The best thing is that they can pair themselves up with strangers based on their playstyle to make Random matchmaking much easier.
  
## Problem We Faced
  Implementation of Matchmaking feature was a huge toll on our time since we were making the site from scratch to begin with, Thinking and adding a new feature in middle of development and changing all schemas and APIs according to that was a big challenge.
